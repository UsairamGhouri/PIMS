# PIMS Local Deployment

This project was created with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). Follow the guide below to set up your local development environment and run the application.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Angular CLI** (Install via `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Open the Project

Open your preferred IDE (we recommend VS Code) and navigate to the project's root folder.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open the integrated terminal in your IDE and run the following command to install all necessary packages.

> **Note:** We use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to ensure compatibility between various dependency versions.

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Once the installation is complete, start the local server by running:

```bash
ng serve
```

### 4. View the Application

After the build is successful, the terminal will provide a local URL (typically `http://localhost:3000/`).

- Click the link in the terminal, or
- Copy and paste it into your web browser to view the application.
